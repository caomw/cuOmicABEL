	default output
		if there are no input parameters(only file's path) output is whole data 
	you can set outfile's name for all parameters. Like this
		./reshuffle.exe --datadims=file=datadimension.txt : output >> datadimension.txt
		./reshuffle.exe --datadslim=file=very_slim_data.txt--chi=20	: output >> very_slim_data.txt
		default file's name are as previous 
	some changes in info messages
