1. Pre-requisites
------------------

  Our software requires the BLAS and LAPACK. If they are not available
  in your system, you can freely download them, for example, from:

  * BLAS: http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/
  * LAPACK: http://netlib.org/lapack/#_software

  Their installation is typically rather straightforward.

  Please, keep in mind that it is important to install an optimized
  version of BLAS, be it OpenBLAS or a different one.


2. Compiling
-------------

  The file make.inc sets a number of environment variables necessary
  for the compilation. The directory inc/ contains several versions of
  make.inc, customized for different combinations of architectures, 
  compilers, and libraries. Choose the most suitable one for you, and 
  overwrite the file make.inc with it. For instance, if you chose to 
  install the BLAS and LAPACK libraries linked above in a linux 
  machine, select the file "make.inc.gnu-goto". You will need to set 
  the paths to the aforementioned libraries in your system.
  
  Once the make.inc file is ready, you can compile the code. Simply 
  type "make" and it will create the binaries "CLAK-GWAS" and 
  "reshuffle" in the bin/ directory.
