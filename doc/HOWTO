1. Who is Whom
---------------

In the directory bin/, you find the following executables:

* CLAK-GWAS: the program to run GWAS analyses (through CLAK-Chol or CLAK-Eig)
* reshuffle: the program to extract the output of CLAK-GWAS into text format

The output produced by CLAK-GWAS is kept in a compact binary format
for performance reasons. The user can then use "reshuffle" to
extract the desired information. Since the output may be very large,
reshuffle allows the selection of specific ranges of SNPs and traits.


2. Preparing your data
-----------------------

Currently, as input CLAK-GWAS only accepts data files in the DatABEL
(filevector) format. Examples of how to transform your data into 
filevector are given in the tutorial available at

http://www.genabel.org/packages/OmicABEL

3. Running GWAS analyses
-------------------------

The tutorial available at

http://www.genabel.org/packages/OmicABEL

also provides a basic example on the use of OmicABEL to run GWAS analyses.
Here we detail the options of CLAK-GWAS. The complete list of options is 
available through the command


The example in the tutorial also provides a basic example on using OmicABEL
to run your GWAS analyses. Here we detail the options of CLAK-GWAS. 
The complete list of options for CLAK-GWAS is avaliable through the command

./CLAK-GWAS -h

Usage: CLAK-GWAS <arguments> [options]

Following arguments are mandatory:

  -cov <path>    base path to the file containing the covariates
  -phi <path>    base path to the file containing the relationship matrix
  -snp <path>    base path to the file containing the SNPs
  -pheno <path>  base path to the file containing the phenotypes
  -out <path>    base path to the file where the output will be stored

Following options might be given:

  -var [chol | eigen] Default is chol.
  -nths <num>         Default is 1 thread.
  -thres <num>        Default is 95(%).
  -h                  Show this help and exit


* The option "-var" selects the algorithm to use:
   "chol" forces CLAK-GWAS to use the CLAK-Chol algorithm (recommended for 
          single-phenotype GWAS).
   "eigen" forces CLAK-GWAS to use the CLAK-Eig algorithms (recommended for
          multiple-phenotype GWAS).

* "-cov", "-phi", "-snp", "-pheno" are used to specify the input files
          for the analysis. If the covariates are stored in the pair of
          file "covs.fvd" and "covs.fvi", the option -cov
          is used as: "-cov covs". Same for the other three options.

* "-out" is used to specify the output file(s)

* "-nths" allows the user to specify how many cores to use.

* "-thres" is used to specify the acceptable proportion of missing values. 
           It must be an integer value between 1 and 100.
           (the missing values are imputed by means, therefore our suggestion 
		   is to keep this threshold at 95 at minimum).
