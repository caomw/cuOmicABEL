3.1  For the sake of ease-of-use, CLAK-GWAS automatically performs
     a number of system checks and tries to maximize performance.
     Should you experience any unexpected behavior, please contact us
     ( fabregat [at] aices [dot] rwth-aachen [dot] de ); we will attend 
     your request as soon as possible.

3.2  Currently, the input data must consist of double precision entries, 
     organized according to the DatABEL (filevector) data format.
     We are working on the support for more datatypes.
